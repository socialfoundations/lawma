This is the primary code base for the project.

1. Go to `data_generation` for all code to create the classification tasks and the fine-tuning dataset.
2. The directory `evaluation` contains code used to evaluate various models on the classification tasks.
3. The directory `fine-tune` contains code to fine-tune Lawma, as well as the for the additional fine-tuning experiments included in the paper.
4. The directory `notebooks` contains ipynb files to generate the plots of the paper.

See the `README.md` files in the subdirectories for additional documentation.
